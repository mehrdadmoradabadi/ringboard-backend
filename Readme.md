## 🎯 Overview

RingBoard is an open-source solution designed to simplify enterprise telephony management with seamless integration into Asterisk PBX. As a VoIP engineer with years of experience in call centers, I know how critical it is to have real-time insights into call processes—like total calls, abandoned calls, and other key reports.

From my experience, there’s no free or open-source tool that provides these essential analytics for call centers. That’s why I built RingBoard—to give admins and call center managers a free and flexible alternative.

Right now, RingBoard is a REST API, but I’m working on a simple UI to make it even more accessible. It’s completely free to use, as long as you follow the license terms. 😃

### How You Can Help
- If RingBoard is useful for you, please ⭐ the project!
- Want to extend it? Fork the repo and contribute!
- Currently, RingBoard only supports Asterisk (since that’s what I have access to). If you can provide access or details for other PBX systems, feel free to create a branch and add support—or contact me!
